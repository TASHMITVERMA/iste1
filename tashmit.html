      The Hulk is a fictional superhero appearing in publications by the American publisher Marvel Comics.In his comic book appearances, the character is both the Hulk,
      a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid possessing a limitless degree of physical strength, and his alter ego Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a physically weak,
      socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist. The two exist as independent dissociative personalities, and resent each other.
      Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays while saving the life of Rick Jones during the detonation of an experimental bomb,
      Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional stress, at or against his will. This transformation often leads to destructive rampages and to
      conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life. The Hulk's level of strength is normally conveyed as proportionate to his level of anger.
